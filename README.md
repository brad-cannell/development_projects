# Development Projects

Repo for my development projects. For now, the primary purpose of this repo is to have a repo to attach cards to in the [Development Projects board](https://github.com/orgs/brad-cannell/projects/25/views/1). It also contains the labels I want to use on the [Development Projects board](https://github.com/orgs/brad-cannell/projects/25/views/1).
