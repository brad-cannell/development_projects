# Development Projects

Repo for my development projects. For now, the primary purpose of this repo is to have a repo to attach cards to in the [Development Projects board](https://github.com/orgs/brad-cannell/projects/25/views/1). It also contains the labels I want to use on the [Development Projects board](https://github.com/orgs/brad-cannell/projects/25/views/1).

## SharePoint

Use this repo, along with the [Development Projects board](https://github.com/orgs/brad-cannell/projects/25/views/1), for tracking and documenting my [SharePoint sites](https://uthtmc.sharepoint.com/_layouts/15/sharepoint.aspx).

Instructions for using this repo are detailed in the [wiki]([https://github.com/brad-cannell/sharepoint/wiki](https://github.com/brad-cannell/development_projects/wiki/SharePoint)).

## R packages

Add more instructions later.
